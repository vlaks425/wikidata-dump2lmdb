# wikidata-dump2lmdb
This is a way to write specific data from wikidata's compressed dump (in this case, it handles the entity's label and its corresponding qid) into the lmdb database in the form of key-value pairs.
Please choose a different library to open the dump file according to the compressed dump format you downloaded.

ToDo: More detailed guide and multi-process read and write.
